# SHMA---Software-managed Caching for Hybrid DRAM/NVM Memory Architectures

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;SHMA is implemented with zsim and NVMain simulators.  Zsim is a fast x86-64 multi-core simulator. It exploits Intel Pin toolkit to collect traces of memory accesses for processes, and replays the traces in the zsim simulator. NVMain is a cycle-accurate memory simulator, it models components of DRAM and NVMs, and memory hierarchy in detail. The integrated "zsim + NVMain" simulators can be forked from "https://github.com/AXLEproject/axle-zsim-nvmain". 

Based on the "zsim + NVMain" hybrid simulator, SHMA has added the following functions:

 * **Memory management simulations (such as MemoryNode, Zone, Buddy allocator etc.)**:   As the pin-based zsim only replays virtual address in the x86 system architecture, and does not support OS simulation, SHMA has added memory management modules into zsim, including memory node, zone and buddy allocator.


 * **TLB simulation:** The original "zsim + NVMain" simulator does not simulate the TLB. TLB simulation is implemented in zsim to accelerate address translations from virtual address to physical address.

 
 * **Implementation of SHMA, a hierarchical hybrid DRAM/NVM memory system that pushes DRAM caching management issues into the software level:** DRAM cache is managed by hardware in tranditional DRAM/NVM hierarchical hybrid systems. SHMA is a novel software-managed cache mechanism that organizes NVM and DRAM in a flat physical address space while logically supporting a hierarchical memory architecture. This design simplifies the hardware design by pushing the burden of DRAM cache management to the software layers. Besides, SHMA only caches hot NVM pages into the DRAM cache to mitigate potential cache thrashing and bandwidth waste between DRAM cache and NVM main memory.
 
 
 * **Multiple DRMA/NVM hybrid architecture supports:** SHMA supports both DRAM/NVM flat-addressable hybrid memory architecuture and DRAM/NVM hierarchical hybrid architecture. As shown in following figure, both DRAM and NVM are used as main memory and managed by OS in a single flat address space. In DRAM/NVM hierarchical hybrid memory architecture, DRAM is exploited as a cache to the NVM, and hardware-assisted hit-judgement mechanism is implemented to determine whether data is hit in DRAM cache. Besides, to reduce hardware overhead, DRAM cache is organized set-associative and usually uses demand-based caching policies.

 *  **Multiple DRAM/NVM hybrid system optimization policies:** We have implemented Row Buffer Locality Aware (RBLA) page caching policy and MultiQueue-based (MultiQueue) page migration policy in DRAM/NVM flat addressable hybrid memory system. RBLA caching policy is a simple implementation of hybrid memory system proposed in the paper "**Row Buffer Locality Aware Caching Policies for Hybrid Memories**", MultiQueue migration policy is a simple implementation of system proposed in the paper "**Page Placement in Hybrid Memory Systems**". RBLA caching policy is aimed at migrating NVM pages with poor row buffer locality to DRAM since row buffer miss of NVM pages incur higher overhead than that of DRAM pages. The MultiQueue migration policy places hot NVM pages into DRAM, and MQ algorithm is used to update the hotness of pages based on time locality and access frequency.

Setup,Compiling and Configuration
------------
**1.External Dependencies**  
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before install hybrid simulator zsim-nvmain, it's essential that you have already install dependencies listing below.
* gcc(>=4.6)
* Intel Pin Toolkit(Already integrates in project, or you can download from [pin-2.13-61206-gcc.4.4.7-linux](http://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/downloads/pin-2.13-61206-gcc.4.4.7-linux.tar.gz))
* [boost](http://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_59_0.html) (version 1.59 is ok)
* [libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/libconfig-1.5.tar.gz)
* [hdf5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/releases/)


**2.Compiling**
* Update environment script env.sh according to your machine configuration
```javascript
#!/bin/sh
PINPATH= path of pin_kit
NVMAINPATH= path of nvmain
ZSIMPATH= path of zsim-nvmain
BOOST= path of boost
LIBCONFIG= path of libconfig
HDF5=path of hdf5
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PINPATH/intel64/lib:$PINPATH/intel64/runtime:$PINPATH/intel64/lib:$PINPATH/intel64/lib-ext:$BOOST/lib:$HDF5/lib:$LIBCONFIG:/lib
INCLUDE=$INCLUDE:$HDF5/include:$LIBCONFIG:/include
LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:$HDF5/lib
CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:$HDF5/include
export ZSIMPATH PINPATH NVMAINPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH BOOST CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH LIBRARY_PATH
```
* Compiling and Installation
```javascript
[root @node1 SHMA]# cd zsim-nvmain
[root @node1 zsim-nvmain]# source env.sh  //init environmental values
[root @node1 zsim-nvmain]# scons -j16    //compiling, -j16 represents that compiling with 16 cores
```
If error "could not exec $PINPATH/intel64(ia32)/bin/pinbin" happens, it means that you are not authorized to execute pinbin, this can be solved with the following command:
```javascript
[root @node1 zsim-nvmain]# chmod a+x $PINPATH/intel64(ia32)/bin/pinbin 
```

* **Using a virtual machine**  
 If you use another OS, can't make system-wide configuration changes, or just want to test zsim without modifying your system, you can run zsim on a Linux VM. We have included a vagrant configuration file (http://vagrantup.com) that will provision an Ubuntu 12.04 VM to run zsim. You can also follow this Vagrantfile to figure out how to setup zsim on an Ubuntu system. Note that zsim will be much slower on a VM because it relies on fast context-switching, so we don't recommend this for purposes other than testing and development. Assuming you have vagrant installed (sudo apt-get install vagrant on Ubuntu or Debian), follow these steps:
Copy the Vagrant file to the zsim root folder, boot up and provision the base VM with all dependencies, then ssh into the VM.
```javascript
[root @node1 zsim-nvmain]# cp misc/Vagrantfile .
[root @node1 zsim-nvmain]# vagrant up
[root @node1 zsim-nvmain]# vagrant ssh
```
Vagrant automatically syncs the zsim root folder of your host machine to /vagrant/ on the guest machine. Now that you're in the VM, navigate to that synced folder, and simply build and use zsim (steps 5 and 6 above)
```javascript
[root @node1 zsim-nvmain]# cd cd /vagrant/
[root @node1 zsim-nvmain]# scons -j4
```

TLB, Page Table and Memory Management Simulation Modules
-----------------------
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As described above, original zsim doesn't support OS simulation, and SHMA has added TLB, page table and memory management simulation into zsim. The major modifications are shown in the following figure. The left side presents the major code of original zsim corresponding to system simulation, **the right side describes SHMA modifications to zsim for TLB, page table and memory management simulation support.**

Architecture of SHMA(software-managed DRAM Caching)
---------------------------
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; SHMA has extended both page table and TLB to maintain both virtual-to-NVM and NVM-to-DRAM address mappings. SHMA also develops an utility-based DRAM caching policy that only fetching hot pages into DRAM cache when the DRAM is under high pressure to reduce DRAM cache pollution. SHMA also supports DRAM cache bypassing mechanism. The following figure shows the architecture of SHMA.![Image of Yaktocat](https://github.com/cyjseagull/SHMA/blob/master/images/SHMA_architecture.png)

Implementations of RBLA and MultiQueue Policies
----------------------------
* **Row Buffer Locality Aware Migrator (RBLA)**  
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;RBLA migrates NVM pages with poor row buffer locality to DRAM, and keeps pages with good row buffer locality in NVM to gain the benefit of row buffer hit. The implementation is shown in the following figure:![Image of Yaktocat](https://github.com/cyjseagull/SHMA/blob/master/images/RBLA.png)


* **hot page migrator based on MultiQueue Alogrithm (MultiQueue)**  
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;MultiQueue classifies NVM pages into hot pages and cold pages using multiqueue algorithm accroding to both page access frequency and time locality. Its implementation is shown in the following figure:![Image of Yaktocat](https://github.com/cyjseagull/SHMA/blob/master/images/MultiQueue.png)

* **Architecture of flat memory supporting different channel configurations of DRAM and NVM**  
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Considering that DRAM and NVM with different channel configurations have the overlapping address space in the low end, we divide the continuous overlapped address space into {channel_nums} and mapping them to different address space interleavingly to make full use of channel parallization.
